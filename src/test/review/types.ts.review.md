## Code Smells

* The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). There are several places where the same code is repeated, for example, in the constructor of the `MockResponse` class and in the `json()` method.
* The code is not very modular. The `MockResponse` class is not very cohesive, as it contains both the logic for creating a mock response and the logic for fetching data from the response.
* The code is not very easy to test. The `MockResponse` class does not have any unit tests.

## Technical Debt

* The code is not very performant. The `json()` method uses a blocking call to `fetch()`, which can make it slow.
* The code is not very secure. The `MockResponse` class does not have any security features, such as rate limiting or authentication.

## Maintainability

* The code is not very easy to maintain. The `MockResponse` class is not very well-documented, and it can be difficult to understand how to use it.
* The code is not very extensible. The `MockResponse` class is not very flexible, and it can be difficult to extend it to support new features.

## Following Patterns

* The code does not follow the standard JavaScript style guide.
* The code does not use any of the standard JavaScript testing frameworks.

## Following Best Practices

* The code does not follow the best practices for writing unit tests.
* The code does not follow the best practices for writing secure code.

## Potential Amount of Bugs

* The code has a high potential for bugs. The `MockResponse` class is not very well-tested, and it can be difficult to use correctly.
* The code is not very secure, and it is likely to have security vulnerabilities.

## Number of Code Duplicates

* There are several places where the same code is repeated.

## Efforts Spent on This Code

* It is difficult to say how much effort was spent on this code. However, it appears that the code was not well-written or well-tested.

## Score from 1 to 12, based on the level of seniority

* I would give this code a score of 3 out of 12, based on the level of seniority. The code is not very well-written, and it is not very easy to maintain or extend.
