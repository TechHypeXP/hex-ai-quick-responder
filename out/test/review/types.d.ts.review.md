## Code Smells

* The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). There are several places where the same code is repeated, for example, the constructor for the `MockResponse` class and the `json()` method.
* The code is not very modular. The `MockResponse` class and the `createMockResponse` function are tightly coupled.
* The code is not very easy to test. There are no unit tests for the `MockResponse` class or the `createMockResponse` function.

## Technical Debt

* The code is not very performant. The `json()` method makes a synchronous call to the `fetch()` function. This could be a problem if the `fetch()` function is slow.
* The code is not very secure. The `MockResponse` class does not have any security features, such as CSRF protection.

## Maintainability

* The code is not very easy to maintain. The `MockResponse` class and the `createMockResponse` function are not very well documented.
* The code is not very easy to extend. It would be difficult to add new features to the `MockResponse` class or the `createMockResponse` function.

## Following Patterns

* The code does not follow the standard JavaScript style guide.
* The code does not follow the standard ES6 features.

## Following Best Practices

* The code does not follow the best practices for testing. There are no unit tests for the `MockResponse` class or the `createMockResponse` function.
* The code does not follow the best practices for security. The `MockResponse` class does not have any security features, such as CSRF protection.

## Potential Amount of Bugs

* The code has a high potential for bugs. The `MockResponse` class and the `createMockResponse` function are not very well tested.
* The code is not very modular, which makes it difficult to track down bugs.

## Number of Code Duplicates

* There are several places where the same code is repeated. For example, the constructor for the `MockResponse` class and the `json()` method.

## Efforts Spent on This Code

* It is difficult to say how much effort was spent on this code. The code is not very well documented, so it is difficult to tell how much time was spent on each part of the code.

## Score from 1 to 12, based on the level of seniority

* I would give this code a score of 3 out of 12, based on the level of seniority. The code is not very well written, and it has a high potential for bugs. It would be difficult to maintain and extend this code.
