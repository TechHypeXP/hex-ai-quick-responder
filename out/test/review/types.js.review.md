### Code smells

* The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). The `MockResponse` class has a lot of duplicated code. For example, the `ok` and `_data` properties are both initialized in the constructor, and the `json()` method returns the `_data` property.
* The code is not very modular. The `MockResponse` class is not very well encapsulated. It has a lot of public properties and methods, which makes it difficult to test and reuse.
* The code is not very secure. The `MockResponse` class does not have any validations to ensure that the `ok` and `_data` properties are valid. This could lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Technical debt

The code has a lot of technical debt. The code is not very DRY, modular, or secure. This could make it difficult to maintain and extend the code in the future.

### Security issues

The code has some security issues. The `MockResponse` class does not have any validations to ensure that the `ok` and `_data` properties are valid. This could lead to security vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Maintainability

The code is not very maintainable. The code is not very DRY, modular, or secure. This could make it difficult to maintain and extend the code in the future.

### Following patterns

The code does not follow some common patterns. For example, the `MockResponse` class does not have a private constructor. This makes it difficult to test and reuse the class.

### Following best practices

The code does not follow some best practices. For example, the `MockResponse` class does not have any unit tests. This makes it difficult to ensure that the class is working correctly.

### Potential amount of bugs

The code has a high potential for bugs. The code is not very DRY, modular, or secure. This could lead to a lot of bugs in the future.

### Number of code duplicates

The code has a lot of code duplication. The `MockResponse` class has a lot of duplicated code. This could make it difficult to maintain and extend the code in the future.

### Efforts spent on this code

It seems like the author spent a lot of time on this code. The code is very complex and has a lot of features. However, the code is not very well written and has a lot of technical debt.

### Score from 1 to 12, based on the level of seniority

I would give this code a score of 3 out of 12, based on the level of seniority. The code is not very well written and has a lot of technical debt. It would be difficult to maintain and extend this code in the future.
