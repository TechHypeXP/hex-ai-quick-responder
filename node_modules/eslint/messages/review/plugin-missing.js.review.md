### Code Smells

* The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). The same error message is repeated multiple times.
* The code is not very modular. It would be better to extract the logic for getting the plugin name and the error message into separate functions.
* The code is not very well-formatted. It would be easier to read and understand if it was formatted more consistently.

### Technical Debt

* The code is not very secure. It does not check if the plugin name is a valid package name. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the plugin.
* The code is not very maintainable. It would be difficult to add new features or make changes to the code.
