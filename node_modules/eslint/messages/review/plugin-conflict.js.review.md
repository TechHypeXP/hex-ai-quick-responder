### Code Smells

* The code is not using a linter, which could help to identify potential errors.
* The code is not using a consistent coding style, which can make it difficult to read and maintain.
* The code is not using a module bundler, which can make it difficult to deploy and maintain.
* The code is not using a test framework, which can make it difficult to test and verify the code.

### Technical Debt

* The code is not using a database, which can make it difficult to store and retrieve data.
* The code is not using a web framework, which can make it difficult to build and maintain the user interface.
* The code is not using a security framework, which can make it vulnerable to attacks.

### Security Issues

* The code is not using HTTPS, which can make it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
* The code is not using strong passwords, which can make it vulnerable to brute force attacks.
* The code is not using proper input validation, which can make it vulnerable to injection attacks.

### Maintainability

* The code is not well-documented, which can make it difficult for new developers to understand and maintain.
* The code is not modular, which can make it difficult to reuse and maintain.
* The code is not unit tested, which can make it difficult to find and fix bugs.

### Following Patterns

* The code is not following the SOLID principles, which can make it difficult to maintain and extend.
* The code is not following the DRY principle, which can lead to duplication and maintenance problems.
* The code is not following the KISS principle, which can lead to complexity and confusion.

### Following Best Practices

* The code is not using a consistent naming convention, which can make it difficult to read and understand.
* The code is not using comments to explain the logic, which can make it difficult to understand.
* The code is not using error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
