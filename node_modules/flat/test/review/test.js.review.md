## Code Smells

The code has a few things that could be improved.

* **The code is not organized into functions.** This makes it difficult to read and understand the code. It also makes it difficult to unit test the code.
* **The code is not using any of the features of ES6.** This makes the code harder to write and maintain.
* **The code is not using any of the features of TypeScript.** This makes the code more error-prone and difficult to understand.
* **The code is not following any style guide.** This makes the code difficult to read and understand.
* **The code does not have any unit tests.** This makes it difficult to ensure that the code is working correctly.

## Technical Debt

The code has a few things that could be improved to reduce technical debt.

* **The code should be refactored to use functions.** This would make the code easier to read and understand, and it would make it easier to unit test the code.
* **The code should be updated to use ES6 features.** This would make the code easier to write and maintain.
* **The code should be updated to use TypeScript.** This would make the code more error-prone and easier to understand.
* **The code should be styled using a style guide.** This would make the code easier to read and understand.
* **The code should be unit tested.** This would make it easier to ensure that the code is working correctly.
