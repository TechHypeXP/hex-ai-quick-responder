### Code Smells

* The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). The `cliCursor.show()` and `cliCursor.hide()` functions have a lot of duplicated code.
* The code is not very modular. The `cliCursor.toggle()` function depends on the `cliCursor.show()` and `cliCursor.hide()` functions.
* The code is not very easy to test. It would be difficult to write unit tests for the `cliCursor.show()` and `cliCursor.hide()` functions without access to a real terminal.

### Technical Debt

* The code uses the deprecated `process.stderr` property.
* The code uses the deprecated `restoreCursor` module.

### Security Issues

There are no obvious security issues in the code.

### Maintainability

The code is not very maintainable. It is not very easy to understand how the code works, and it would be difficult to make changes to the code without breaking something.

### Following Patterns

The code does not follow any well-known patterns.

### Following Best Practices

The code does not follow many of the best practices for writing JavaScript code. For example, the code is not very DRY, and it is not very modular.

### Potential Amount of Bugs

The code has the potential for a lot of bugs. The code is not very easy to test, and there are a lot of opportunities for errors.

### Number of Code Duplicates

There is a lot of code duplication in the `cliCursor.show()` and `cliCursor.hide()` functions.

### Efforts Spent on This Code

It is difficult to say how much effort was spent on this code. However, it seems like the code was not written with a lot of care.

### Score from 1 to 12, Based on the Level of Seniority

I would give this code a score of 1 out of 12, based on the level of seniority. The code is not very good, and it would not be suitable for use in a production environment.
